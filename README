This program reads a JSON description of a MongoDB cluster and instantiates it on Amazon EC2 servers. The JSON
configuration file supports the full description of both the EC2 instances to be used and the Mongo cluster
architecture. For an example configuration file, see config/example.json.

To start and stop clusters, use:
./start_cluster.py [cluster name] [configuration file]
./stop_cluster.py [cluster name]

These scripts assume that the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY environment variables have been set.
